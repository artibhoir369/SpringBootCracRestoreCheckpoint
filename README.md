# SpringBootCracRestoreCheckpoint
# Prepare a Spring Boot app with CRaC
For our tutorial, we will use a Spring Boot reference application, Spring Petclinic.

First of all, clone the Spring Petclinic's repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
```
To use CRaC with the new Spring Boot and Spring Framework, we need to add the dependency for the org.crac/crac package to pom.xml:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.crac</groupId>
    <artifactId>crac</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```
Let's check the difference of our updated pom.xml:
```
git diff
diff --git a/pom.xml b/pom.xml
index 287a08a..f403155 100644
--- a/pom.xml
+++ b/pom.xml

   <dependencies>

+        <groupId>org.crac</groupId>
+        <artifactId>crac</artifactId>
+        <version>1.4.0</version>
+    </dependency>
     <!-- Spring and Spring Boot dependencies -->
     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
```
Now, build the application with

```
mvn clean package
```
# Prepare a work directory for the application dump

CRaC enables the developers to save the exact state of a running Java application (together with the information about the heap, JIT-compiled code, and so on). We need to create a work directory where the application dump will be stored after the checkpoint.

For this purpose, run

```
mkdir -p storage/checkpoint-spring-petclinic
```
We should also copy the Petclinic's jar file to the “storage” to use in a docker container:


```
cp target/spring-petclinic-3.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ./storage/
```
# Start the application in a Docker container

We will use the bellsoft/liberica-runtime-container:jdk-21-crac-slim-glibc image to start Petclinic and get the application dump for further restore. Note that BellSoft also provides images with musl libc.

Another important prerequsite is the kernel version of the underlying Linux distribution, which should be at least 5.9. Linux kernel 5.9 introduces the CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE option, which separates the checkpoint/restore functionality from the CAP_SYS_ADMIN option and enables the developers to steer clear of running containers with elevated permissions.

The CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE (and SYS_PTRACE, which is also required for checkpoint-restore) options are enabled with --cap-add flag added to newer Docker versions, so make sure you have the latest available Docker version.

Use the following command to start the application in a Docker container:

```
docker run --cap-add CHECKPOINT_RESTORE --cap-add SYS_PTRACE -d -v $(pwd)/storage:/storage -w /storage --name petclinic-app-container bellsoft/liberica-runtime-container:jdk-21-crac-slim-glibc java -Xmx512m -XX:CRaCCheckpointTo=/storage/checkpoint-spring-petclinic -jar spring-petclinic-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
If you use a Linux distribution with an older kernel version, you can you the --priviledged flag instead of CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE and SYS_PTRACE (however, this is not the best practice to run containers with elevated permissions).

Now, let’s check the application output.

```

```
We can see that The PetClinicApplication started in 17.305 seconds.

# Perform the checkpoint to get the application dump
The jcmd command is used to send the command to VM to make the checkpoint and dump the application and VM state to storage:

```
docker exec petclinic-app-container jcmd spring JDK.checkpoint
```
As a result, the Java instance with the Petclinic app will be dumped and the container will be stopped. The docker ps will show that the petclinic-app-container was stopped.

You can check that the images for your application were dumped to the directory:

```
ls storage/checkpoint-spring-petclinic/

# Use the prepared dump to start the application and the VM

Let’s start the application by restoring it from the dump. To do that, run


```
docker run --cap-add CHECKPOINT_RESTORE --cap-add SYS_PTRACE -it --rm -v $(pwd)/storage:/storage -w /storage -p 8080:8080 --name petclinic-app-container-from-checkpoint bellsoft/liberica-runtime-container:jdk-21-crac-slim-glibc java -XX:CRaCRestoreFrom=/storage/checkpoint-spring-petclinic
```

Check the application logs:


```
root@ip-172-31-39-178:/home/ubuntu/spring-petclinic# docker logs petclinic-app-container-f
rom-checkpoint
2024-07-24T11:41:57.920Z  INFO 129 --- [Attach Listener] o.s.c.support.DefaultLifecycleProcessor  : Restarting Spring-managed lifecycle beans after JVM restore

```

We can see that restoration of checkpoint was very quick.

Summary:
Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace offers several benefits in terms of boot startup time for applications or services:
Fast Application Startup: It allows for the quick restoration of a previously checkpointed application or service. This means that instead of starting from scratch, the application can resume from a saved state, significantly reducing the startup time.
State Preservation: It captures and saves the complete state of an application, including its memory, CPU state, and open file descriptors. When restoring from a checkpoint, the application continues execution from where it left off, avoiding the need for time-consuming initialization steps.
Improved Resource Utilization: By reducing startup time, It enables faster scaling of applications and services. This capability is particularly beneficial in cloud environments where rapid scaling based on demand is essential.
